# Pre-trained Model Comparison for Art Restoration

## Available Options

### 1. Real-ESRGAN
**Purpose:** Super-resolution and restoration
**Pros:**
- Excellent for general image enhancement
- Pre-trained on diverse datasets
- Very easy to integrate
- Great for upscaling low-resolution artwork
- Active development and support

**Cons:**
- Primarily focused on super-resolution, not specific damage repair
- May not handle complex structural damage well
- Large model size (60MB+)

**Best for:** Enhancing resolution, general quality improvement

---

### 2. DeOldify
**Purpose:** Colorization and restoration of old photos
**Pros:**
- Specifically designed for historical images
- Excellent colorization capabilities
- Good for faded/aged artwork
- Moderate model size

**Cons:**
- Focuses heavily on colorization
- May not be ideal for already-colored artwork
- Less effective for physical damage (tears, holes)

**Best for:** Black & white or severely faded artwork

---

### 3. Pix2Pix (Pre-trained + Fine-tuning)
**Purpose:** General image-to-image translation
**Pros:**
- Can be fine-tuned on your small dataset
- Flexible architecture
- Good balance of quality and speed
- Works well with paired data (which you have)

**Cons:**
- Requires fine-tuning for best results
- Training time needed
- May need more data for robust performance

**Best for:** Custom restoration when you have paired data

---

### 4. Stable Diffusion Inpainting
**Purpose:** Fill missing regions using AI
**Pros:**
- State-of-the-art quality
- Excellent for filling holes and missing parts
- Can handle complex textures
- Pre-trained on billions of images

**Cons:**
- Very large model (4GB+)
- Slower inference
- Requires significant GPU memory
- May hallucinate details that weren't there

**Best for:** Structural damage, missing parts, tears

---

### 5. GFPGAN (Face Restoration)
**Purpose:** Face enhancement and restoration
**Pros:**
- Excellent for portraits
- Pre-trained, ready to use
- Good at detail recovery
- Fast inference

**Cons:**
- Only works well for faces
- Not suitable for landscapes, objects
- Limited to portrait artwork

**Best for:** Portrait/face artwork specifically

---

## Recommendation Based on Your Dataset

### Your Current Situation:
- Small paired dataset (112 images)
- Mixed artwork types (portraits, scenes)
- Need general restoration capability
- Want production-ready solution

### Recommended Approach: Hybrid Multi-Model System

**Primary Model: Real-ESRGAN**
- Reason: Best general-purpose enhancement
- Use for: 80% of images with moderate damage
- Easy to integrate, no training needed

**Secondary Model: Stable Diffusion Inpainting**
- Reason: Handles structural damage (tears, holes)
- Use for: 20% of images with severe damage
- Your ML system detects when to use it

**Optional: GFPGAN (if portraits detected)**
- Reason: Superior face restoration
- Use for: Portrait artwork specifically
- Face detection gates this model

### Implementation Strategy:

```
Image Input
    |
    v
ML Damage Analysis (your FFT features)
    |
    +---> Light damage (sharpening_need < 0.4)
    |         --> Classical methods (fast)
    |
    +---> Moderate damage (0.4 - 0.7)
    |         --> Real-ESRGAN (general enhancement)
    |
    +---> Severe damage (> 0.7)
              |
              +---> Has structural damage (tears/holes)?
              |         --> Stable Diffusion Inpainting
              |
              +---> No structural damage?
                        --> Real-ESRGAN (strong mode)
```

## Decision: Start with Real-ESRGAN

**Why:**
1. Easiest to integrate (pip install)
2. No training required
3. Works well out-of-the-box
4. Good performance on diverse artwork
5. Can add other models later

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Install Real-ESRGAN
2. Create wrapper class
3. Integrate with your hybrid system
4. Evaluate on your test set
5. Add other models if needed

**Expected Results:**
- PSNR: 25-32 dB (vs your current 11 dB)
- Processing time: 0.5-2 seconds per image
- Memory: 2-4 GB GPU (or CPU fallback)

## Next Steps

1. Install Real-ESRGAN
2. Test on sample images
3. Compare with your current ML approach
4. Measure improvement
5. Integrate into production pipeline
6. (Optional) Add Stable Diffusion for severe cases
